# NostrPostr - A nostr client and library for Android

**THIS IS NOT PRODUCTION READY! THIS IS ONLY PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO GET COLLABORATORS TO HELP TO GET A
PRODUCTION READY PRODUCT EVENTUALLY! AS OF WRITING THESE LINES, THIS CODE IS A DEMO APP THAT DOES
NOT SHOW ANYTHING TO THE USER. DEVELOPERS CAN SEE IT IS DOWNLOADING ONE NOSTR ACCOUNT'S EVENTS.**

As of the date of creation of this repository there was no Android nostr client. There was no nostr
library for Android neither. The goal is to provide both with a focus on a clean and generally
usable, fully featured library and a client with basic functionality.
